# Optimal transport on the real line

A simple, efficient and fully numpy based(!) solver for the one dimensional optimal transport problem with arbitrary convex cost. Two functions are implemented, one returns the ot-cost and the two dual solutions. The other is a bit less efficient and returns the ot-cost and the transport plan.
